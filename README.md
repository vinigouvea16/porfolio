# tailvinicss

This is my porfolio's first version. After finding out about animations and the necessity of having a portfolio I came up with the design in order to apply the knowledge recently learned. I also created my personal developer brand, the 'tailvinicss,' a 'play' on the frontend technology Tailwind CSS and my name, Vinicius - nicknamed Vini - and if you notice, 'vinicss' is almost 'vinicius,' so it fits perfectly.


## Insights Gained

Like many portfolios, I found myself tasked with crafting the design, delving into the creative process, and applying my knowledge of animation libraries such as GSAP and Framer Motion. This project presented significant challenges, yet it was also immensely enjoyable and rewarding. I trust you'll derive as much pleasure from it as I did.
